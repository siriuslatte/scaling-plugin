    <h1>Scale Plugin</h1>
</div>

A plugin made to help with some of the scaling within my own games and future games, it is open-source because why not? I was already planning in actually open-sourcing most of the libraries here (mostly the instances one, which is the most interesting one).

You can download the source, clone the repository, fork it, download the plugin or get it from the store, do as you like. This is not another plugin like the Scaling Lite one, this one is recursive and works with other `GuiComponents` as well, which is the **great** advantage whe using this plugin over the ones already in the market.

Anyway, thanks to all those who have been my inspiration and thanks for everyone supporting the development of any of my games!
